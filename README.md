# Data Analysis Portfolio

## About me

Jonathon Austin

Starting out in Art History, I've uncovered a whole new world in data analytics. I've taken my love for understanding complex masterpieces by the greatest artists to diving into datasets, finding patterns and insights, and communicating them efficiently (but also aesthetically). Now, I'm curating data-driven solutions. I'm all about Python, SQL, and visualization tools.
