# About me

Jonathon Austin

Starting out in Art History, I've uncovered a whole new world in data analytics. I've taken my love for understanding complex masterpieces by great artists to diving into datasets, finding patterns and insights, and communicating them efficiently (but also aesthetically). Now, I'm curating data-centric solutions. I'm all about Python, SQL, and visualization tools.

This proposal involved building an operational dashboard analyzing the e-commerce performance of [Google Merchandise Store](https://shop.merch.google/). The dataset utilized was the [Google Analytics 4 - Google Merch Store](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?utm_source=demoaccount&utm_medium=demoaccount&utm_campaign=demoaccount#/p213025502/reports/intelligenthome), provided by Google for demonstration purposes. By using the official data source directly from Google, we can ensure that the analyzed data is authentic, reliable, and representative of real-world scenarios. This dataset provides a comprehensive range of data points and metrics — granting opportunity to explore various aspects of e-commerce data, such as user acquisition, session engagement, product performance, and revenue trends.

This task was accomplished on Looker Studio (FKA Google Data Studio), Google’s data visualization and reporting platform. The choice was based on it integrating seamlessly with a range of data sources, such as Google Sheets, BigQuery, and most importantly in this case, Google Analytics (GA4). This streamlines data management and the analysis workflow, avoiding complex data transformations or any third-party tools. GA4 uses an event-based data collection model, meaning it captures and tracks individual user interactions across various devices and platforms as events. Its granular level of data capture matters in e-commerce contexts because it allows for detailed analysis of user actions  (e.g. product views, add-to-carts, purchases).

Upon an exploratory examination of the dataset, I understood a user analysis would be important in understanding user behaviour and characteristics. This allows us to begin addressing the query 'Who are our customers?'.

The website sessions section represents the activities of users on the e-commerce platform. This is paramount as optimizing user sessions leads to improved experiences and increased conversions. This section grants insight into user behavior and the customer journey. We can explore session duration, event count, and conversions per device type. These insights help answer questions like: How are users accessing and navigating the website? What tracked user events are most and least prominent?

The core of any e-commerce business is the performance of products and revenue generated. A product and revenue analysis is essential for understanding which products drive user interest, identifying top-selling and underperforming products, and monitoring revenue trends over time.

**Results:** (Describe the outcome of the project and any significant findings)

- Summarize the key insights and findings you've derived from your analysis, tying them back to the overall business objectives or questions you aimed to address.
- Highlight the value and impact of your dashboard in supporting data-driven decision-making for the Google Merchandise Store or similar e-commerce businesses.

## Operational Dashboard — Grocery Chain

**Tools Used:** Looker Studio

A leading grocer chain in Portugal has requested a dashboard to afford stakeholders an overview of business sale performance across retail locations in the country. The original XLSX dataset was subject to data cleaning and transformation. It contains sales data, employee count and performance, and special events, opening hours, observed holidays, and special campaigns at store level.

The resulting dashboard was divided into two distinct pages: one focused on revenue analysis and the other dedicated to store-level analysis. 

The Revenue Analysis provides insights into sales revenue, sold items, and their distribution across stores, regions, cities, and years. By laying out the sales revenue and sold items per store we help identify top-performing and underperforming stores, enabling targeted interventions or replicating best practices. Visualizing the same metrics per region and city is revealing of regional variations in sales performance, informing regional strategies and resource allocation, as well as the influence of urban demographics or local market conditions on sales performance.

The Store-Level Analysis delves into employee count, productivity, and the relationship between employee metrics and store performance. Plotting a count comparison of traditional cashiers and self-checkout booths per store reveals insights into customer preferences and the adoption of self-service technologies across different locations. Lastly, scatter plots comparing employee count with store productivity and store revenue uncover relationships between staffing levels and store performance, informing stakeholders of staffing needs and resource allocation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis — The Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access

**Tools Used:** Looker Studio

**Link:** 

In 2017, the Metropolitan Museum of Art released an API to the public, providing access to over 420,000 data points regarding their collection. We will be using the downloadable version of this dataset available on GitHub at [https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess).

Once the data is imported into a pandas dataframe, we begin an exploratory analysis of the variables to understand the nature of the dataset. Subsequently, I propose a deeper look into the collection leveraging variables that shed light on the types of art the museum has acquired from various regions throughout the years.
